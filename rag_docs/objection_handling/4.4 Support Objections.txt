Support Objections (Partner/Spouse)


* What is it? 
   * How we navigate partner / spouse objections. 
   * We use this AFTER we’ve isolated it. 
* Purpose:
   * Tie down certainty on the process (Create a 2v1) 
   * Gather intel about the spouse/partner
   * Use that intel to find the best way to navigate. 
* Key Distinctions
   * You really want to eliminate this on the front end. 
   * This is more for spouse. For partner… I highly recommend you get them all on the same call (Exception being you already vetted and the partner can make the decision)
   * When you’re narrowing down the “two spouse objections” if you get an unclear answer assume it’s “permission” 
   * Feminine energy or people who aren’t head of household, you’ll probably want to “delay” and set follow-up (as long as you know they’ll get on the follow up) 


Step 1: Isolate & Tie Down


(this part you may have done before, but regardless… make sure you tie down TWICE before getting into the objection handling)


So aside from letting your spouse know… there isn’t anything else keeping you from being less than 100% certain that this is what you want to do? 


Awesome… so just hypothetically, if you’re spouse was on this call and said “Bob, I believe in you and you do whatever is best for us and your business” you’d be 100% in? 


Step 2: Two Spouse Objections:


Awesome I totally get that and agree with you. No problem at all (also bring up you’re married to if you are). 


Now just for clarity's sake: 


#1) Is this a “respect” thing to where no matter what you’re going to do this regardless, you just want to let her know beforehand out of respect? 


Or #2) Do you need her permission to move forward? Meaning it’s not ultimately your sole decision to make? 


Step 3: Information-Gathering


* What’d you think she’ll think about this?
* What’d you think she’ll say when she hears the investment? 
* Is she supportive of you trying to fix ____? 
   * Are you guys on the same page that this is a problem? 
* Is she involved in the business? What’s she do? 
* Do they know about us (the company)?
* Do they know you’re on this call? 
   * What would they think if they knew? 
* Can you talk to your spouse right now? 
* When do you think you can talk to your spouse? 


Step 4: Clarify & Contrast


Gotcha so I appreciate you being open and honest with me about that. 


(Optional - don’t do if redundant) Now just to clarify what you said, based on where you guys are at financially right now really any big decision is something that you guys will need to sit down and talk about, correct? (clarifying what they said). 


Great so look… I definitely want you to go talk to your spouse about this but I want to remind you that there’s two ways you can bring this up to your spouse: 


1. It can be a conversation in which you go up to your partner and say: Hey honey you know that business of mine that I’ve spent a ton of money on only for it to give us constant ups and downs and stress? Well, I hopped on a call with this guy I met on the internet who might be able to help us, it’s 7k and uh, what’d you think? Here’s the details... 
2. Or it can be a conversation where you sit down and tell her confidently “Hey babe I know I’ve let you down with this business and I know that despite all of that you’ve supported me every step of the way to this point. And I want to let you know that I’ve DECIDED and I’ve COMMITTED to growing this to where it SHOULD be already and I’ve found someone to help us get there, but before I move forward… I want to get your emotional support and buy in so I know we’re in this together. 


Now, let me ask you… which one of those two guys do you think is going to convince his wife?  


You’re right - because if YOU’RE not certain about this… then she’s not going to be either. Nor should she be. Because with scenario #1 you’re weak and uncertain in your direction as a leader and as a man. 


So look the real question is… when you go to talk to your spouse, which one of those two guys are you going to be? The first or the second? 


Are you sure? Because if there’s anything else that’s keeping you from being less than 100% certain that this is what you want to do - let me know and we can talk about that.  


Outcomes:
1. You end up getting an uncertainty objection (the real objection)
2. It’s just a “respect” thing and you can deposit close
3. It’s a “permission” thing and you CC close or follow-up close. 


Step 5: Deposit / Follow Up Close


Scenario #1 (Use If “Respect”): 1k Deposit Close


Great, so what we’ll do from here is put down a refundable deposit to hold your spot AND so you can draw the line in the sand about that commitment to making this change. 


Then if, by chance, your wife is going to divorce you over this and everything goes south… no worries at all we’ll go ahead and refund the deposit. We’re not in the business of ending marriages lol


So we’ll go ahead and do that deposit now, and then set a follow-up call to re-review things that your spouse is more then welcome to join if she wants. And then we can figure out what’s the best next step from there. Does that make sense? 


Sound good? 


Great - the deposit is just 1k. 


What’s your billing address…? 


Outcomes:
1. You get deposit and set follow up (still use follow up language to remove risk)
2. You don’t get deposit (dig into why, and possibly transition to CC close or Follow-Up)


Scenario #2 (Use If You Don’t Think The 1k Deposit Will Fly): CC Close


Great… so what we’ll do from here is - I’ll take you credit card number down and even though we aren’t going to run anything to you give it the go, this just acts as a commitment that this is something you’re serious about so that we’re both on the same page. Sound good? 


Then when do you think you’ll be able to talk to your spouse? 


Cool so we’ll take that down now, and then set up a call on Tuesday to go over any questions and see what the best next step is from there. Sound good? 


Great - what’s your billing address? 


Scenario #3 (Use If You Don’t Think Anything Will Fly, Or They Refute #1/#2): Follow-Up Close.


Great - so when do you think you’ll be able to talk to you spouse? 


(FYI - if this is anything other than TONIGHT or TOMORROW… then you want to call it out)


Awesome… so go talk to her, and then let’s set up another call on Tuesday to go over any questions you might have and figure out what our best next step is from here. Sound good? 


And look - if you still feel good, we can talk about getting going sooner rather than latter. 


And if you start to feel like now isn’t the right time, no worries at all. Let’s still keep our call and at the very worst I’ll give you some homework to work on until you’re ready and we’ll keep the communication and relationship open until the time is right. 


Does that sound good?
