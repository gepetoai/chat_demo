Reframes


The “Call Out” 


Can I be honest with you for a second…?


You just got done telling me _____….


And now you’re saying that (or it seems like) ____…. 


...what’s really going on here? 


“It’s A Simple Decision” 


Look I get your concerned about ___ …


...but the decision is really simple: 


Do you want to stop (pain / cost / urgency) and (have outcome / desire) or not? 


The “Real Decision” 


The real decision isn’t if you’re going to work with me or anyone else out there…


...the real decision is are you ready to have your ACTIONS align with your WORDS. 


The real decision is, are you ready to stop (pain / cost / urgency) and start (outcome / desire) or not? 


Doesn’t matter to me… but that’s really what’s at stake for you here. 


“Confusing The Problem With The Solution” (Circumstance vs Vision)


A totally hear you and can appreciate that you don’t feel like you can do this because of because you don’t have enough time (or insert whatever problem)


...but I also want to remind you, that not having enough time is exactly what you got on this call in the first place. 


So if the very problem that you got on this call to solve, is exactly what is going to keep you from getting started on fixing the problem… then you’re in a self-perpetuating loop  -and you’re stuck.


Make sense? 


So the real question is NOT when is going to be the right time... 


It’ll never feel like the right time. 


The real question is, when are you going to stop making decisions based on current circumstances and instead based on your vision? 


...because if you keep making decisions based on current circumstances, you’re only going to generate what? More of the same. 


...but when you start making decisions on your future vision, well you open yourself to a whole world of possibility. 


So which one of those ways do you wanna go? 


Do you want to be the person who is constantly reactive, making decisions based on their current circumstances and constantly going in circles? 


Or the person who is able to get uncomfortable because that MEANS getting in alignment with their vision?


The “That’s Exactly The Reason Why”


In this one, you reframe the objection as exactly why the need to get started. See ex below:


The Story Reframe


You would use this as the “reframe” in CIAPATT


* Permission
* I had a client who also ____ (ideal client) and he was also ____ (experiencing the same pain / objection)
* ...but he realized ____ (the reframe, “that was exactly the reason why”)
* And therefore ___ (he experienced the same result) 


Now can I be honest with you for a second…?


I had a client named Bob who was also a struggle health coach (same type of client) 


...and he was in a position where his business was failing and the only way he could possibly do it was using credit, but he just felt like it wasn’t responsible financially based on where he was at


...but then he realized, that was exactly the reason he needed to do it. He was in a place where he didn’t even have 5k to his name. And to him, that wasn’t acceptable. 


So he bit the bullet and got uncomfortable because he KNEW a decision like that was truly the shift he needed to make to become a real entrepreneur…


...and because he did, now he’s doing about 50k/m on a consistent basis. 


So the real question is… (the go into contrast) 


How Would You Feel If…?


Can I be honest with you…?


How would you feel if you missed out on your only change to ____ (change your situation) 


How would you feel if you because you didn’t do this, you’re in the same exact spot this time next year? Still struggling with ___ and ultimately making no progress (their pain)


How would you feel if 6 months from now, your situation gets even worse and then you can’t even do this if you wanted? 


The “Cost” Reframe


Can I be honest with you…?


Earlier on the call you told me ____ (the consequence of what’s going to happen if they don’t change) 


...so what’re you going to do if you don’t do this? 


Ex: 


Earlier on the call you told me that you’re wife told you that if you don’t figure it out by the new year that means going back to your 9-5 and you said you’d rather jump out your office window then have to do that…


...so let me ask you, what’re you going to do if you don’t do this? 


“Chunking Down To The Ridiculous”


(Works great with pricing objections for non-ROI offers)


So when you say it’s too much, what’d you mean? 


Gotcha well I hear you and appreciate you bringing that up. Thank you. 


And I also want to reassure you that a lot of my clients felt that way before they put it in proper context. 


Now, that said, can I be honest with you? 


Earlier on this call you told me that your worst fear was your health getting even worse and then 10-15 years from now having to go through the same health struggles your father did, right? The ones that cost 10 or even 15k in medical bills to cover, no? 


...and beyond that, it’s not just about avoiding that, but you also want to have a body that when you look into the mirror you don’t feel shame. And instead you can actually feel good in your own skin for the first time since your 20s. 


So I want to realign you with that for a moment. And put this all into proper context…


...because while I get that 5k right now might seem a little scary, this is an investment to get your HEALTH back. Your SELF-ESTEEM back. Not just now, but for the rest of your LIFE! 


...and to get that outcome, I guarantee if you put in the work you’ll be there in less than a year. 


So just to put the investment in context here…


5k spread across 365 days in a year is just over 10 dollars a day. Across 5 years is 2 dollars a day. 


Is that too much to invest in getting your health back for a lifetime?
