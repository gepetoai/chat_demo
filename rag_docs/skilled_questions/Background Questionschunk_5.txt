logically like you did. Yeah I mean there's a lot of things that are going on you know and it could be one to where it kind of has lost it because of the stuff going on right so I wouldn't beat yourself up about it just we want to handle it as good as we can. Awesome. Anyone else going once, going twice? There was a question about what do you think about sending them a short questionnaire. I answered it. Okay just double checking on that one. Going once, going twice, going three times. I'm glad you guys like this training. I'll have Becca splice this up and add it to the course just of what I went over in terms of the process framework and add those resources. I think this will help you guys a lot if you do this especially you know and I noticed you Sam like had kind of a Frankenstein script. That's how you process it down to where like you get it down to like 40 minutes tops so should be good. Alright guys we'll see you next week. I'll post this in the group. I'll have a Becca splice it down and post it in the course. Levi do you have a question? Or are you just saying bye? You're being silent so I don't know. I'll stay on for a minute with you. Okay cool and then David's gonna stay on. Okay we'll see you guys.
